## Overview

This research project aims to provide insights and forecasts for specific variables derived from the options file. The primary methodology leverages the Random Forest model, but other models are also explored.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have MATLAB installed and set up.
3. Navigate to the root directory of the project and run `main.m`.

## File Descriptions

- `main.m`: The main script that initializes the environment, loads data, and processes it for forecasting.
- `options.m`: Contains various settings and configurations for the forecasting models.
- `forecast_rf.m`: Function to perform forecasting using the Random Forest model.
- `forecast_models.m`: Incorporates various forecasting models based on the data and settings provided.

## Options and Settings

Refer to the `options.m` file for detailed configurations like the number of out-of-sample periods, AR lags, forecast horizons, and more.

## Usage

To use the forecasting tools:

1. Adjust the settings in `options.m` as needed.
2. Run the `main.m` script.
3. Results will be generated based on the models and settings chosen.
